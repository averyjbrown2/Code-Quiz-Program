# code-quiz-program  


### Description  
This application presents as a timed code quiz. It opens to a welcome page that details the parameters, that ten seconds will be deducted for every incorrect answer chosen. The user can then select the start button, beginning the quiz, which lasts 60 seconds. After completing the final question, or once the timer runs out, the user is taken to a screen which allows them to input their initials. After entering their information, the user is directed to the high scores page, which lists the initials and times for recent users. This application demonstrates several concepts: saving to and accessing local storage, dynamically creating elements, and manipulating timers, for example.
