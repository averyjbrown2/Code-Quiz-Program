# Code-Quiz-Program
after user answers question, use loop 
question index++
no for loop to move you through questions. it would be too fast.
one js file for each page, use 2 htmls. use bootstrap for page setup in htmls.
Make sure quiz gets you to the end which shows you your points, before you start working on high scoreboard.
use pseudocode to help get plan together to write the code.

var currentQuestionIndex = 0;

if (current)
function displayQuestion() {
    var currentQuestion questionscurrentQuestionIndex];   
    currentQuestionIndex.answerIndex

}


function answerChosen() {
currentQuestionIndex++;
displayQuestion();
}


choiceList.addEventListener("click", answerChosen);
